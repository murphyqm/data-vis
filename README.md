# Data Vis

A list of useful resources for building data visualisations, and teaching the art of data vis.
Resources are loosely grouped by theme/topic, and then within that grouped by resource type (tutorial, library,
discussion, tools etc.).

Inclusion on this list is not an endorsement of these resources: research and best practises may change; portions of a tool or guide may be useful
while other aspects are less so. This list is subject to update and change when needed.

## General "Good data vis" guidelines

Overall guides, "best practises", starting points for creating data visualisations.
